You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
You take the red pill - you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
I think it's a half-gram heavy on the back end.
Sister, they don't know what to do with just one of me.
JARVIS, make a note. Remind me not to wake up in the morning ever again.
You get hurt, hurt ’em back. You get killed… walk it off.

Do you want to go on holiday together?
I'm going to a birthday party tomorrow.
I have plans with my family this week.
Nevermind. We will find some time later.
Let's go have dinner at a restaurant.
I couldn't be of any assistance.
Come and dance the night away with me.
Chocolate-covered strawberries. Tasty.
Killing me softly with this song.
You only live once, so try to live well.
