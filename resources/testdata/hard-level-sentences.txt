Do you want to go on holiday together?
I'm going to a birthday party tomorrow.
I have plans with my family this week.
Nevermind. We will find some time later.
Let's go have dinner at a restaurant.
I couldn't be of any assistance.
Come and dance the night away with me.
Chocolate-covered strawberries. Tasty.
Killing me softly with this song.
You only live once, so try to live well.
